# How to access Hidden Menu's
## Dealer Mode
### 7-3-1 Method
From my exploration, the only way I have been able to access Dealer Mode (DM) is by following these steps:
1. Go to Setup -> General -> SW Info 
2. Turn the volume to 7 and then tap the top bar that says, "General Settings"
3. Turn the volume to 3 and then tap the top bar that says, "General Settings"
4. Turn the volume to 1 and then tap the top bar that says, "General Settings"
5. Once you have tapped the General Settings bar all 3 times, you should hear a "beep" and see a keypad
6. Type in `2400`

If the keypad doesn't show, you may need to turn on the "FM Radio" for it to work (I'll test this later to confirm and edit)
