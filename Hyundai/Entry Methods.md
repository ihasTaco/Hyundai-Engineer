## Uncomfirmed Methods
I have been reading a bunch of different forums, here are some Entry Methods that I have tried but can not get to work so, I am putting them here just in case I am just dumb.

### Screensaver Method
I don't think this one will work, because in the videos I saw, the screensaver menu has a 3x1 grid with big buttons, but in my 23 Sonata, it is a list of buttons
1. Go to Setup -> General -> Display -> Screensaver, You should see 3 buttons, "Analog", "Digital", "None".
2. At the bottom of each button should be a blank space, click each in order from, left to right, then right to left, you may need to do this twice.

### Storage Method
`TODO: Figure out what the button and menu names are called`

This one may work, but I havent been able to get the keypad to come up, maybe im not doing the sequence right, or it doesnt work in newer updates 🤷‍♂️
1. Go to Setup -> General -> Info(?) -> Storage
2. Underneath "Available" below the line, tap once
3. Underneath "Used(?)" below the line, tap twice
4. Between "Used(?)" and "Available", above the line, tap once
5. Between "Used(?)" and "Available", below the line, tap once
6. Underneath "Available" below the line, tap once

### 7-3-1 Method (single dial)
`TODO: Figure out what the button and menu names are called`

I think this one is the 7-3-1 method, but used with only one dial (like my sonata) but it has some extra steps, idk if this method is used for older cars or not, but im putting it here.
1. Hold the "Star" button until the "(?)" menu pops up, and at the bottom of the left list, tap "Vol(?)"
2. Change it to, "(?)"
3. Tap the "Home" button
4. Turn the volume to 7, and press the volume button
5. Turn the volume to 3, and press the volume button
6. Turn the volume to 1, and press the volume button
7. Once you have tapped the volume button all 3 times, you should hear a "beep" and see a keypad
