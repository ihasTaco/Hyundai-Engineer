# Hyundai/Kia Engineer Mode

Goals: 
I want a centralized space for all the information regarding the Hyundai/Kia Engineer Mode, including links to other resources that may help someone.
Eventually, I want make a list of year, makes, models, Head Unit Platform, Update, HU Model, Software Version, etc. that someone can find their year/make/model and HU Firmware to find the codes needed to get into the dealer, engineer mode, etc. of their car
Also having a wiki that will tell users what each option does would be nice too.

I only have access to my 2023 Hyundai Sonata, so that is what I am gonna be focusing on getting this setup. At first this is going to be a list of ways to get to the hidden keypads to enter codes, and codes that I used, if you have any information you would like to share, open an issue and I can add it, or you can make a fork and merge it with the added information!
